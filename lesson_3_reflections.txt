When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    You'd want to do this when you want to work with others on a common project or
    if you'd like to have a simple project hosted on github (a website for example)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    In order not to pull commits which could create conflicts with what I am
    working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
 one instead of another?

    clones = a repo which is a local clone of a local or distant repository (GitHub)
    fork â‰ˆ a clone but from a github repository to another github repository
    branches = to create different versions of a project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    In case you need to work offline and see the changes that were added to the
    remote and/or resolve conflicts between your local master and the remote master
